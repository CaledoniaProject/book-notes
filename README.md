# ðŸ“š Book Notes

This repository is a personal collection of notes, highlights, and reflections from the books I've read. It's part reading log, part knowledge archive, and part thinking tool.

## ðŸ“– What's Inside

Each book has its own folder or markdown file, containing:
- **Summary**: Key ideas and structure of the book
- **Highlights**: Quotes and memorable passages
- **Notes**: My thoughts, interpretations, and takeaways

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure

For now I organize my reading into four categories: finance, individual developer & entrepreneur, information security, and leadership.

* [Finance](finance)
* [Individual Developer & Entrepreneur](individual-developer)
* [Information Security](security)
* [Leadership](leadership)
