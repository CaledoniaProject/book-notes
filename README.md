# ðŸ“š Book Notes

This repository is a personal collection of notes, highlights, and reflections from the books I've read. It's part reading log, part knowledge archive, and part thinking tool.

Each book has its own folder or markdown file, containing:
- **Summary**: Key ideas and structure of the book
- **Highlights**: Quotes and memorable passages
- **Notes**: My thoughts, interpretations, and takeaways

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure
